# VelliDB

![build status](https://github.com/ZingLix/VelliDB/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

VelliDB will be a distributed key-value database based on Raft and Rust.

This project does not aim to replace any current famous database, but to learn distributed systems like LSM-Tree, Raft, Percolator, etc. 

I plan to write blogs about the design and implementation of VelliDB during the development.
